Let's say you have been playing piano for a while now. You know a few chords like C, G, Am, F. 

Someone may have taught you to play these chords by finding a C note (learn how to identify any note), and then playing two notes up, and then another two notes up. You're now playing the notes "C", "E", and "G". Cool! This sounds great. 

This methodology works on all the other chords: find the note, play two notes up, then another two notes up! But why does starting on A create A minor (it sounds sadder than the rest), and how would you play a chord that starts on a black key??

The problem here is you may not know how chords are actually *built*. I think learning chords by a general shape is good, but it only works on notes that start white keys, and depending on the note, you may get a major or a minor chord. Granted, you can always look up one of these charts below, but that is __a lot__ to memorize. 

Let's look at the anatomy of a chord!


## Anatomy of a Chord
To begin, let's simply define a 'chord.' In very basic terms, a chord is three or more notes played or heard at the same time. Some combos of notes sound good together like our "C-E-G" above, and some sound much more complex like a Db7(#9, #13) which has the notes "Db-F-Ab-Cb-E-B". What we're focusing on right now is the three note variety of chords called __triads__. Triads are three notes that are separated by a "third" which is three musical letters away. More on this in a second!

So, triads have three notes that sound good together. Each of these three notes has a role in the chord. The lowest note and the note that gives that chord it's name is called the *root*. In an F chord for example, it is the __F__ note. 

    F Chord: F - A - C


The next note is called the *third*. Sorry, I know it may be confusing because this is the second note of the chord, but hopefully the terminollogy will make more sense soon. In the F chord, it is  the __A__ note.


Lastly, we have the *fifth* of the chord. Again, in the F chord, it is the __C__ note.


Each note in the chord has a role. A small change to any of these notes will result in a different chord. 

Every triad has these three notes that make it up. A root, a third, and a fifth. Here's a few examples below: 


| Chord Name | Root | Third | Fifth |
| :----- | :--------| :--   | :------|
| C Major | C |  E| G|
| D Minor | D | F| A|
| E Minor | E | G| B|
|F Major| F| A| C|
|G Major| G|B|D|

So hopefully we understand a bit more of what makes up a chord. But how do we play a major vs minor chord?

## The Third
Now that we have some terminology down, lets zoom in on the __third__. The third of the chord is what makes it major or minor? The term third can actually be more specific: we have both major thirds and minor thirds. A note with a major third above and a fifth creates a major chord, whereas a a note with a minor third above and a fifth creates a minor chord. There! Mystery solved... Not quite! 

We need to be able to distinguish between a major and minor third now. This is actually not too hard. 

First, let's reiterate what a third is. Let me list some examples of thirds: C to E is a third, F# to A is a third, B to D is a third, B to D# is a third. Thirds a simply the name of a relationship between two notes that are separated by to letter names. They can be sharp, flat, or any combo of the two, but they will all create some *type* of third. 

We are really only focused on major and minor thirds for now though. They both have a very clear definition. 

Major thirds are notes that are 4 half steps away. "C" to "E" if we count both black and white keys is separated by the notes "C#", "D", and "D#". This is a 4 half steps away which makes a major third. Another example if E to G#: "F", "F#", and "G" separate the notes. The trick here is remembering to count __both__ black and white keys! We often say note "y" is a major third above note "x". "E" is a major third above "C"; "G#" is a major third above "E". Try to figure out what note is a major third above "Bb". (Don't cheat!)













Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
